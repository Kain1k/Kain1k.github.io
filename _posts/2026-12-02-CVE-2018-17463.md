Welcome to my first CVE analysis blog. We’ll take a detailed look at **CVE-2018-17463** and learn how to exploit it. This isn’t just a normal write-up, we’ll go over the basic ideas behind exploiting a browser on Windows, including how to build primitives like `addrOf` and `fakeObj`, and finally how to execute arbitrary code using a Type Confusion bug. You can think of this as “part three” of my Chrome Exploitation series. This is a heavy, deep-dive blog, so get ready - we’re going all the way in.

Before getting started, make sure you have built the correct vulnerable version of V8. I have a detailed guide that walks you through the process [here](https://kain1k.github.io/posts/CVE-2018-17463-setup/).

## Background
In September 2018, [Issue 888923](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40092548) was reported to Google’s security team through Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program. The vulnerability was discovered by **Samuel Gross** during a source code review and was later used in the [Hack2Win](https://ssd-disclosure.com/hack2win-extreme-warm-up/) competition. One month after the fix was released, the issue was publicly disclosed through an SSD advisory titled “[Chrome Type Confusion in JSCreateObject Operation to RCE](https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-chrome-type-confusion-in-jscreateobject-operation-to-rce/)” which outlined key details of the bug and included a comprehensive proof-of-concept demonstrating its exploitation.

Later that same month, Samuel presented a talk at Black Hat USA 2018 titled “[Attacking Client-Side JIT Compilers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emt1yf2Fg9g)” where he explored vulnerabilities in JIT compilers — especially issues involving redundancy elimination and how side effects are modeled in the intermediate representation (IR). It wasn’t until 2021 that he published a Phrack article called “[Exploiting Logic Bugs in JavaScript JIT Engines](https://phrack.org/issues/70/9.html#article)” which offered a much deeper explanation of how CVE-2018-17463 was originally discovered and exploited.

Let’s begin our analysis by examining the initial commit that fixed the bug we’re studying. We’ll try to reverse engineer the patch to understand how the vulnerability can be triggered, using the knowledge we’ve built so far.

## Analysis of CVE-2018-17463
Looking at [Issue 888923](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=888923), we can see that the initial fix was introduced in commit `52a9e67a477bdb67ca893c25c145ef5191976220`, titled “[turbofan] Fix ObjectCreate’s side effect annotation.” With that in mind, let’s run the `git show` command inside our V8 repository to examine exactly what changes this commit made.
